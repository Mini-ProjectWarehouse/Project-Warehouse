Project Warehouse is a curated collection of 12 mini web development projects, each designed to demonstrate essential frontend skills and concepts. Every project features a live demo along with clean, reusable snippet code, making it perfect for learning, practicing, or quick implementation. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the components are fully responsive, interactive, and developer-friendly â€” all organized in one seamless interface.

This project was created by Team PETA, a group of five passionate developers: Aryan, Asar, Sandip, Christina, and Pujan.
